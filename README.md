# Timestamped COVID stats

These are files indicating the data the PHE coronavirus dashboard had stored at various points in time. This helps to link for instance reporting date and specimen date.

The most useful directory is `all` which contains case data for all types of regions: utla, ltla, nations, etc. Other folders are mostly experimental.

`archive` contains similar data from `2020-04-09` to `2020-08-03`. Early timepoints here do not include LTLA data.

`utla_cases` includes coverage of a period from `2020-09-10` to `2020-09-22` not covered by other data.
